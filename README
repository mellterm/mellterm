== Welcome to Mellterm

Mellterm is a translation and terms toolkit aimed to faciliate the developer life

=== The Technical 

Mellterm is a rails app, running on rails 2.3.10 with ruby 1.8.7, and eventually will run rails 3.0.2 with ruby 1.9.2

To run ruby 1.9.2, all plugins need to be stable enough and file upload for unicode files needs to be fixed. 

Mellterm is a CPU intensive application because it has to parse large file, zip, unzip, build files (export) and muliple mysql queries per request.

=== Used Gems

* rspec *
* rspec-rails * 
* rspec-rails-ext *
* rspec-unit *
* rspec_generator *
* searchlogic *
* authlogic *
* will_paginate *
* fastercsv *
* xml-simple, :lib => xmlsimple *
* bcrypt-ruby, :lib => bcrypt *
* vestal_versions *
* papaerclip *
* factory_girl *
* rails-settings *
* country_select *


== So, before running 'rake gems:install' install rspec to make sure rake db:migrate works

  gem install rspec rspec-rails rspec-rails-ext rspec-unit rspec_generator
